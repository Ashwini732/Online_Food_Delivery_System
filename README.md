# Online_Food_Delivery_System
This project presents a detailed analysis of Software Development Life Cycles for an Online Food delivery system. 
The main aim of this project is to study different Software Development Life cycles models and understand how they affect management and requirement gathering in a real world.
In this project, I have compared three models such as Waterfall Model,Incrementel Model and Spiral Model.
To manage the project properly, I used Git branching.
The main branch contains the final and stable version of the project.
A separate branch was created to make updates and improvements to the requirements document.
Changes were committed step-by-step instead of uploading everything at once.
After reviewing the updates, the branch was merged into the main branch.
This approach helped me:
Keep track of changes
Avoid losing previous versions
Maintain a clean and organized repository
